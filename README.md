# UPDATE SOURCE RELEASE
- At this point, 3/24/23 as of writing: 12:08 AM.
- I have decided to release the Eternal Hub source-code for Redwood Prsion.
- Reasons being:
1. The game is dying.
2. There is other people out there trying to dethrone others who use scripts for the game
3. Every script was horribly made with mine being the only good one.
4. I have no reason to hold on to the source any longer as I do not exploit anymore or play Redwood Prison whatsoever.
5. Three people that I know of have attempted to clone my kick method, multiple of my things inside this Gui and everything else I made as a side-project. People thought they were copying it from redwood gui by nameless, jalos. But they weren't, It was from mine. 

- You can find the source code under the "Source" file with intructions on how to use it
- To everyone who knows me as Mil#1522 or D00M this message below is for you.
- Greetings and farewell, from me to you, the exploiting community still behind Redwood Prison. It was a fun adventure being able to make a outstandingly awesome Gui for redwood. I made a ton of people happy, I also made a ton of people mad. I had some issues along the way, some being other people, roadblocks that I eventually overcame or people who just wanted nothing but the worst for me. Overall, it was a learning journey for me personally and I met a few people who I thought to be cool. Back in 2019, I was among the first to use Redwood Gui by nameless and jalos. Personally, I was a huge fan, I wanted to do somethinmg similar but not copy to create outrage, coming 2022 I did just that. I made Eternal Hub which was one of my longest lasting and only public (non leaked) script of mine, I made robux from it, I made a community. This message serves one purpose, to put everyone to ease. I do not plan on coming back, I will not return to Redwood community. Those who wanted to be "better" than me, I wish you the best of luck. I hope anyone who sees this source code will use it to learn or have fun with it. I Included everything, the VIP, the perm part creation, the kicking of other players, even to how to do certain things to other people using the script. I would like to finish by saying, thank you Jalos and nameless for inspiring me to create another redwood script in the first place.
